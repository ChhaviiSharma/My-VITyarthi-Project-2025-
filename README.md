The algorithm of the project is given below :

1.Start
2.Firstly we enter the the account number of the user and that will give details about that user such as name, balance, account type, pending loans, documents of the user.
3.Then we will check whether the the account is applicable for taking loan or not by asking about pending loans.
4.If the account holder is applicable then we will ask them about the required documents such as ITR statement, credit score and a government ID.
5.After this will take input from the user about the principal amount for the loan, the time period and the rate of interest .
6.The program will calculate the simple interest and the the amount to be repaid. It will also divide the total amount to be repaid per month for two years.
